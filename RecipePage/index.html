        <p>Made with tender meat chunks, carrots, and potatoes in a deliciously seasoned sauce on a stove top. Easy to make, comforting, and so delicious.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 pounds Beef Chuck Roast cut into 2-inch chunks, excess fat removed</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon Coarsely Ground Black Pepper</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons Gluten-free All-Purpose Flour or Whole Wheat for non-gluten</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil or avocado oil</li>
          <li>½ Yellow Onion Chopped Large</li>
          <li>4 Garlic Cloves minced</li>
          <li>1 Large Carrot or two small-medium, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
          <li>2 Yukon Gold Potatoes diced into 2-inch pieces</li>
          <li>2 Cups Beef Broth see note</li>
          <li>¼ Cup Tomato Paste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>
          <li>1 Bay Leaves</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons Fresh Thyme Leaves to garnish
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 325° F.</li>
          <li>Season the 2 pounds Beef Chuck Roast (cut into chunks) on all sides with 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt and ½ teaspoon Coarsely Ground Black Pepper. Sprinkle the 2 tablespoons Gluten-free All-Purpose Flour over and toss the seasoned beef to coat it on all sides</li>
          <li>Heat the 2 tablespoons Olive Oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown the beef in batches, on all sides, for 3-4 minutes per batch. Don’t worry about cooking the beef all the way through at this stage. Transfer the browned beef to a plate and set aside.</li>
          <li>Add the ½ Yellow Onion (chopped), 4 Garlic Cloves (minced), and 1 Large Carrot (chopped) to the Dutch oven, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes, or until lightly browned.</li>
          <li>Add the 2 Yukon Gold Potatoes (chopped), 2 Cups Beef Broth, ¼ Cup Tomato Paste, 1 Bay Leaves, 2 teaspoons Fresh Thyme Leaves, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce, and use a wooden spoon to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
          <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring, and return the beef to the pot. Cover the Dutch oven, and transfer to the preheated oven</li>
          <li>Cook the stew for 2-2.5 hours, or until the beef is very tender. Remove the bay leaves</li>
        </ol>
