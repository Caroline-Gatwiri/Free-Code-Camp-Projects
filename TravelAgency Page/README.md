## 📄 About This Project

This is a basic HTML webpage showcasing a fictional travel agency with:

- A welcome message  
- Package options (Group Travels & Private Tours)  
- Beautiful destination images with captions  

It uses only **HTML** (no CSS or JavaScript), making it perfect for beginners who want to practice semantic structure and accessibility features like `alt` text and `<figcaption>`.
